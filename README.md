Steps of Implementation (Deploying & Running on GitHub)
    1. Project Planning and Structuring
        Define the objective: 
          Create a virtual assistant (Viras) that interacts dynamically.
        Choose technologies: 
          HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, XML, PHP, SVG for frontend and backend integration.
        Plan the repository structure for GitHub deployment.
    2. Setting Up the Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SVG)
        HTML:
          Create a structured layout for the assistant interface.
          Include sections for greetings, user input, and responses.
          Integrate the MIC SVG icon for interaction.
        CSS:
          Style the UI to be responsive and user-friendly.
        JavaScript (JS):
          Handle user interactions.
          Fetch data from the server using AJAX (XMLHttpRequest) or Fetch API.
          Update the UI dynamically based on user input.
    3. Structuring Data with JSON & XML
        JSON:
          Store structured data for greetings, responses, and assistant introduction in a .json file.
        XML:
          Structure an alternative data storage format in a .xml file for greetings and responses.
          Store both data.json and data.xml in the GitHub repository so the frontend can fetch the data.
    4. Implementing Server-Side Logic (Using GitHub Pages & Workarounds for PHP)
        GitHub Pages does not support PHP directly, so follow these steps
         Option 1 (Host Backend Elsewhere & Use GitHub Pages for Frontend)
            Deploy PHP backend on a free backend hosting service like:
            000WebHost (https://www.000webhost.com/)
            Heroku (Using PHP buildpack)
            Render (render.com)
            In the GitHub repository, update JavaScript Fetch API to send requests to the external PHP backend.
          Option 2 (Convert PHP Logic to JavaScript for GitHub Pages Support)
            Since GitHub Pages only supports static files, replace PHP with JavaScript-based logic:
            Use JavaScript Date Object for fetching time & date.
            Store responses in JSON instead of dynamic PHP.       
    5. Connecting Frontend & Backend
         If using GitHub Pages (Frontend Only, No PHP)
         Host HTML, CSS, JS, JSON, XML files in the GitHub repository.
         Fetch data dynamically using JavaScript.
         Convert PHP-based functionality into JavaScript where possible.
         If using an External Backend (PHP Supported)
         Modify JavaScript Fetch API calls to request data from the hosted PHP backend.
    6. Uploading to GitHub & Deploying on GitHub Pages
      Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository
          Go to GitHub and create a new repository.
          Name it (e.g., Viras-Virtual-Assistant).
      Step 2: Upload Project Files
          Add HTML, CSS, JS, JSON, XML files to the repository.
          If using an external backend, make sure your JavaScript fetches PHP responses from the external host.
      Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages
          Go to Repository Settings → Pages.
          Under "Branch", select main (or gh-pages if you created a separate deployment branch).
          Click Save.
          Your project will be hosted at: https://your-username.github.io/Viras-Virtual-Assistant/
      Step 4: Test & Debug
              Open the deployed link and check the console for errors.
              Fix any JavaScript issues related to Fetch API.
              If using an external backend, ensure the API calls are working.

Evidence of Work:
    HTML:
      • Defines the character encoding, viewport settings, and the title of the webpage.
      • Links to an icon (logo.jpg) and an external CSS file (style.css) for styling.
      • Displays an image logo (logo1.jpg).
      • Shows a heading introducing "Viras" as a virtual assistant.
      • Includes an animated voice icon (voice.gif).
      • Features a button with a microphone icon (mic.svg) and text prompting the user to click and talk to the assistant.
      • A link to an external JavaScript file (script.js) to add interactivity to the webpage. 
    CSS:
      • Resets margin, padding, and sets box-sizing to border-box for all elements. The body is set to have a black background, and it uses flexbox to center the content both horizontally and vertically.
      • The logo is set to a width of 20% of the viewport width and has a margin on the top.
      • The h1 text is styled with a white color, using the "Protest Guerrilla" font, and it has a custom color for "Viras" (pink) and "Virtual Assistant" (teal) in larger font sizes.
      • The voice icon (#voice) is initially hidden.
      • The button is styled with a gradient background, centered text, and rounded corners. It has a box shadow for a 3D effect, and it transitions with increased shadow and letter spacing when hovered over. 
    JS:
      • The assistant gives a audio responses using SpeechSynthesisUtterance, supporting different functions like greetings, current time, date, and fetching data from PHP, JSON, and XML files.
      • Listens to user commands and converts them to text, which triggers various actions such as opening websites (e.g., YouTube, Google, Instagram), fetching weather data, telling jokes, playing music, and more.
      • The assistant responds using a selected voice (e.g., "Microsoft Hazel") and provides actions based on recognized commands, such as searching Wikipedia or news.
      • Commands can include opening apps, fetching specific data, or even controlling the browser to search for or display content. 
    JSON :
      • The greetings section includes messages for morning, afternoon, and evening.
      • The whoAreYou field provides an introduction about the virtual assistant.
      • The responses section contains default responses for greetings like "hello", "bye", and "thanks". 
    MICSVG :
      • The first path defines a circular shape with a stroke, likely forming part of a circular icon or ring.
      • The second path outlines a line and shapes that might depict a direction or signal, with a round stroke at the end. 
    PHP :
      • Sets headers for JSON content and allows all origins (CORS).
      • If the request method is GET and the action parameter is provided: o Returns the current time in H:i:s format if action is 'getTime'. o Returns the current date in Y-m-d format if action is 'getDate'.
      • If the action is not recognized, it returns an error message.
      • If no action is specified, it returns a welcome message.
      • If the request method is not GET, it returns an error message. 
    XML :
      • A <greetings> element containing:
        o A <morning> greeting for the start of the day.
        o An <afternoon> greeting for mid-day.
        o An <evening> greeting for the end of the day.
      • A <responses> element with three sub-elements:
        o <hello> for a greeting response. o <bye> for a farewell response.
        o <thanks> for a polite acknowledgment response.

Conclusion : 
        This project explored various technologies including JSON, SVG, PHP, and XML, each contributing to different aspects of the development process. PHP handled server-side logic, SVG provided visual 
        representation, and XML structured data. These tools helped clarify the connection between backend and frontend technologies, as well as the management of responses and requests. A key takeaway was 
        understanding how backend and frontend technologies work together to create dynamic web applications. JSON and XML were used for data handling, while PHP implemented logic, emphasizing the importance 
        of client-server communication.  This project reinforced how modern web applications rely on structured data formats and server-side processing to provide real-time updates, improving user interaction 
        and experience.
